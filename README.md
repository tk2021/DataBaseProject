# DataBaseProject
Baseball Statistics Search Engine
Users are able to input values in the forms and the results will be retrieved from the database, which
contains MLB statistics, and then be presented back to the users. 
The database contains over 300,000 tuples and is connected to the site that contains the search engine. 
There are three different sets of data to query, which are for pitching, batting, and fielding statistics.
