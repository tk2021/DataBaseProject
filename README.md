# DataBaseProject
Baseball Statistics Search Engine

Users are able to input values in the forms and the results will be retrieved from the database, which
contains MLB statistics, and then be presented back to the users. 

The database contains over 300,000 tuples and is connected to the site that contains the search engine.

Within the site, there are three different sets of data to query:

Pitching
Batting
Fielding

Code uses HTML, CSS, Java, and Python

HTML and CSS are used to create the forms and style the site.

Java is used for inputting the data into the database.

Python is used for getting information from the forms and generating the appropriate queries.

Base.html is the starting styled page from which all other pages inherit from
including the Welcome Page.
